## Developing an open-source Python implementation of the Fast Multipole Algorithm (FMM) for scientific applications. ##

The FMM can be used in many scientific computing applications: the simulation of many stars, electrostatics, the calculation of atoms or molecules out of equilibrium, and particle methods for continuum problems. The advantages of the FMM can be huge when large numbers of particles are involved, as it reduces the complexity of calculations from O(N<sup>2</sup>) to O(N).

A more widespread adoption of the FMM algorithm has not occurred, mainly due to the complexity of the algorithm and the considerable programming effort, when compared with other algorithms like particle-mesh methods, or treecodes providing O(N log N) complexity.

We are developing an open source implementation of the FMM â€”with particular application to the calculation of a velocity field induced by N vortex particles.

**February 2008** -- at this time, we release a stable _alfa_ version of the Python code, and invite interested parties to email us if they would like to collaborate with us on further developments.

> Although the literature on the subject provides theoretical error bounds for the FMM approximation, there are not many reports of the measured errors in a suite of computational experiments.  We have performed such an experimental investigation, and summarized the results of about 1000 calculations using the FMM algorithm, to characterize the accuracy of the method in relation with the different parameters available to the user.  In addition to the more standard diagnostic of the maximum error, we supply illustrations of the spatial distribution of the errors, which offers visual evidence of all the contributing factors to the overall approximation accuracy: multipole expansion, local expansion, hierarchical spatial decomposition (interaction lists, local domain, far domain). This presentation is a contribution to any researcher wishing to incorporate the FMM acceleration to their application code, as it aids in understanding where accuracy is gained or compromised.
